        <p class="text-secondary">Jul 06, 2025 by <a href="#">TenantFit</a></p>
        <h1 id="tenant-screening-start-smart-with-pre-screening">Tenant Screening: Start Smart with Pre-Screening</h1>
<p>Tenant screening is a <strong>multi-stage process</strong> that needs to be carefully followed to help you find the best candidate for your rental property. This is one step you don’t want to compromise on — selecting a solid tenant will ensure your <strong>peace of mind</strong> for months (or even years) to come. A good tenant means a smoother landlord-tenant relationship, someone who takes care of your property, and a reliable income stream — while you provide a well-maintained space they can enjoy.</p>
<p>There are plenty of services and forms out there that help with tenant screening. But many of them jump right into asking for highly sensitive details like banking info, credit scores, and employment history. While those details are important later, going in too deep too soon can feel invasive — and may turn away quality applicants.</p>
<p>At <strong>TenantFit</strong>, we believe that tenant candidates should have a chance to remain <strong>anonymous</strong> at the beginning of the process. Only after a landlord has narrowed down their shortlist should they request more personal information. This respects the privacy of applicants while giving landlords better control over their screening efforts.</p>
<p>This approach also makes practical sense. In many areas, landlords are not allowed to charge tenants for application or screening fees — so keeping the early screening stage light helps avoid unnecessary costs or friction.</p>

<h2 id="pre-screening-stage">Pre-Screening Stage</h2>
<p>To collect initial information, you’ve got a couple of options.</p>
<p>📝 <strong>Option 1: Old School</strong><br />
Prefer pen and paper? You can use this <a href="files/2025-07-06-tenantfit-pre-screening-form-v1-onca.pdf" target="_blank">Pre-Screening application PDF form</a> and send it directly to the candidate. They print it, fill it out, scan it, and send it back. Then you manually assess who’s worth moving to the next step.</p>
<p>🌐 <strong>Option 2: Online (and easier!)</strong><br />
<a href="https://tenantfit.ca/#register" target="_blank">Register for free</a>, <a href="https://tenantfit.ca/blog/tenantfit-open-registration/" target="_blank">add your property</a>, and send the link to the interactive form to candidates. They fill it in on their phone or computer, and you get clean, structured responses you can compare at a glance.</p>
<p>Here’s an example <a href="https://tenantfit.ca/#publicProperty?id=03980949-b29d-47c2-a001-3b226f704788" target="_blank">public listing link</a>.</p>
<p>TenantFit stores everything securely, gives you a side-by-side view of applicants, and even suggests your best-fit candidates based on your criteria.</p>

<h3 id="detecting-red-flags-and-inconsistencies-early">🔍 Detecting Red Flags and Inconsistencies Early</h3>
<p>Before you go to the next step, take a moment to verify the pre-screening data for consistency.<br />
If you’re using TenantFit, the app will suggest a match score based on your property criteria — but you’ll still want to keep an eye out for red flags like these:</p>
<h4 id="inconsistent-or-vague-responses">Inconsistent or vague responses</h4>
<ul>
<li>Claims they own their home but list “moving because of eviction”</li>
<li>Says “living with friends” but provides a landlord reference later</li>
<li>🚩 Watch out for vague or evasive answers like “just looking for a change”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rental-history-vs-time-at-current-address">Rental history vs. time at current address</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lists only one address for the past 5 years but says they’ve lived there “less than 6 months”</li>
<li>🚩 Frequent moves (all under 12 months) could signal instability</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rent-payment-history-vs-reason-for-moving">Rent payment history vs. reason for moving</h4>
<ul>
<li>Admits to late rent but says they’re moving due to sale of current property</li>
<li>🚩 Conflicting info should prompt follow-up questions</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="vehicle-ownership-vs-parking-needs">Vehicle ownership vs. parking needs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Has 2–3 vehicles but selects “1 parking space” or none at all</li>
<li>🚩 Mentions boats or motorcycles without noting storage or parking</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="employment-stability-vs-income-level">Employment stability vs. income level</h4>
<ul>
<li>High reported income but under 6 months at current job</li>
<li>🚩 Could indicate unverifiable or exaggerated claims</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="business-activity-at-home">Business activity at home</h4>
<ul>
<li>Selects “self-employed” but says “no business activity”</li>
<li>🚩 Home-based businesses might impact lease or insurance — clarify intent</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="housing-vs-profession">Housing vs. profession</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lists a high-income role (e.g., surgeon) but “currently living with friends”</li>
<li>🚩 Could signal financial instability or misrepresentation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="more-signs-of-potential-issues">More signs of potential issues:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t complete the short form — hesitation itself can be a signal</li>
<li>Conflicting answers (e.g., claims rental experience but selects “no” for private landlord)</li>
<li>Generic or vague replies: “N/A,” “none,” or “just looking”</li>
<li>Behavioral tone: overly flattering, evasive, or in a rush to schedule viewings</li>
<li>Says they're “ready to rent sight unseen” or wants to send a cashier’s check from overseas</li>
<li>Offers to pay above asking rent or deposit — may be a scam indicator</li>
<li>Lifestyle fit: Mentions owning a boat, but your property lacks suitable storage</li>
</ul>
