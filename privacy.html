  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-06-15</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
    <p>TenantFit is committed to protecting the privacy of users. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>TenantFit is designed to minimize data collection. We do not ask for or store personally identifiable information such as full names, addresses, identification numbers, or uploaded documents.</p>
    <p>In some cases, users may submit basic, general information (e.g. responses to screening questions, email addresses for communication). This information is used solely to operate the core functionality of the app.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To enable landlords or rental agents to receive and organize responses from interested rental applicants</li>
      <li>To allow candidates to be contacted by landlords through the app interface (without sharing contact details directly)</li>
      <li>To provide limited, anonymous screening and ranking of candidate responses</li>
      <li>To improve the Service and monitor functionality</li>
      <li>To communicate with users who have provided consent, including occasional updates, service-related announcements, or important changes to the platform.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to secure all data handled by the application. Sensitive information is not requested or retained. Communication features that involve contact between users are handled in a way that prevents direct exposure of email addresses unless a tenant voluntarily replies.</p>
    <p>Access to backend systems is restricted to authorized administrators only. All communications between your browser and our servers are encrypted using HTTPS.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Financial Information</h2>
    <p>  TenantFit does not collect, store, or process any financial or payment information directly. All payments and billing transactions are securely handled by a trusted third-party payment processor, which is responsible for the encryption, storage, and transmission of your financial details.</p>
    <p> At no point do we have access to your full credit card number, bank account, or payment credentials.</p>
    <p> For more information on how your payment data is handled, please refer to the payment processor’s privacy policy.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>6. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>TenantFit does not sell, rent, or share your information with third parties except:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When required by law or legal process</li>
      <li>To prevent fraud, abuse, or harm to the Service or its users</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No user data is used for advertising purposes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
    <p>TenantFit may use minimal technical cookies strictly for session management or anonymous usage statistics. No third-party tracking cookies or advertising cookies are used.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. International Users</h2>
    <p>TenantFit is operated from Ontario, Canada. If you are accessing the Service from outside Canada, you agree that your data may be stored and processed in Canada, and you are responsible for complying with your local data laws.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes are made indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
